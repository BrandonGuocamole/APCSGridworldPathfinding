# CS2 Gridworld A* Pathfinding for Capture the Flag

A repository for the Capture the Flag final project in AP Computer Science A. The goal is to create a competitive algorithm to compete against other students in a capture the flag competition hosted within the GridWorld Case Study code given by College Board. 

Our strategy implemented the A* graph traversal algorithm. We chose this algorithm as it provided an elegant solution for pathfinding to allow our actors within the GridWorld to find the optimal path to the opponent's flag. We chose A* over other algorithms due to the fact its wide applicability, and we found that the O(b^d) time complexity was not an issue do to the relatively small amount of data that was to be processed as a part of the capture the flag competition.
